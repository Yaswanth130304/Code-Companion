For example, $\\\\textbf{GACT}$ and $\\\\textbf{AAGTGCCT}$ are both steady genes.\\n\\nBear Limak is a famous biotechnology scientist who specializes in modifying bear DNA to make it steady.  Right now, he is examining a gene represented as a string $\\\\textit{gene}$.  It is not necessarily steady.  Fortunately, Limak can choose one (maybe empty) substring of $\\\\textit{gene}$ and replace it with any string of the same length.\\n\\nModifying a large substring of bear genes can be dangerous.\\nGiven a string $\\\\textit{gene}$, can you help Limak find the length of the smallest possible substring that he can replace to make $\\\\textit{gene}$ a steady gene?\\n\\nNote: A substring of a string $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$ is a subsequence made up of zero or more contiguous characters of $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mathrm{~S~}}$.\\n\\nAs an example, consider $\\\\textit{gene}=\\\\textit{ACTGAAAG}$.  The substring $\\\\boldsymbol{AA}$ just before or after $\\\\mbox{G}$ can be replaced with $\\\\textit{CT}$ or $\\\\boldsymbol{TC}$.  One selection would create $\\\\textbf{ACTGACTG}$.\\n\\nFunction Description\\n\\nComplete the $\\\\textit{steadyGene}$ function in the editor below.

      "\n",
      "The problem focuses on finding the smallest substring within `gene` that needs replacement to make the entire gene \"steady.\" A steady gene has an equal count of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' nucleotides. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Solution Approach**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Character Counts:** Calculate the frequency of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input `gene`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Excess Counts:** Determine how many extra occurrences of each nucleotide exist compared to the required count for a steady gene (which is n/4).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sliding Window:** Use a sliding window approach to find the smallest substring containing all the excess nucleotides:\n",
      "    - Maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, both initialized to 0.\n",
      "    - Expand the window to the right (increment `end`) until the window contains at least the excess count of each nucleotide.\n",
      "    - Once the condition is met, try shrinking the window from the left (increment `start`) while still satisfying the excess count requirement.\n",
      "    - Keep track of the minimum window size encountered during this process.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example (Using Sample Input)**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **`gene = \"GAAATAAA\"`**\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Character Counts:**\n",
      "   - 'A': 6\n",
      "   - 'C': 0\n",
      "   - 'G': 1\n",
      "   - 'T': 1\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Excess Counts (n/4 = 2):**\n",
      "   - 'A': 4 \n",
      "   - 'C': -2 (deficit, but we'll address this in the window)\n",
      "   - 'G': -1\n",
      "   - 'T': -1\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Sliding Window:**\n",
      "   - Initially, the window is empty.\n",
      "   - Expand the window until it includes at least 4 'A's, which happens at index 4 (substring \"GAAA\").\n",
      "   - We need at least one 'C', 'G', and 'T'.  Continue expanding until this is satisfied. This happens at the end of the string. \n",
      "   - The minimum window size is 5, corresponding to the substring \"AAATA.\"\n",
